description: |-
  Manages persistent connections using Net::HTTP including a thread pool for
  connecting to multiple hosts.

  Using persistent HTTP connections can dramatically increase the speed of HTTP.
  Creating a new HTTP connection for every request involves an extra TCP
  round-trip and causes TCP congestion avoidance negotiation to start over.

  Net::HTTP supports persistent connections with some API methods but does not
  make setting up a single persistent connection or managing multiple
  connections easy.  Net::HTTP::Persistent wraps Net::HTTP and allows you to
  focus on how to make HTTP requests.
