# What tests can be run?

[[_TOC_]]

## The two types of QA tests

First of all, the first thing to choose is whether you want to run orchestrated
tests (various Docker containers are spun up and tests are run against them,
also from a specific Docker container) or instance-level tests (tests are run
from your host machine against a live instance: a local GDK installation or a staging/production instance).

Ultimately, orchestrated tests run instance-level tests, the difference being
that these tests are run from a specific Docker container instead of from your
host machine.

## Orchestrated tests

Orchestrated tests are run with the `gitlab-qa` binary (from the
`gitlab-qa` gem), or in the `gitlab-qa` project, with the `exe/gitlab-qa` binary
(useful if you're working on the `gitlab-qa` project itself and want to test
your changes).

These tests spin up Docker containers specifically to run tests against them.
Orchestrated tests are usually used for features that involve external services
or complex setup (e.g. LDAP, Geo etc.), or for generic Omnibus checks (ensure
our Omnibus package works, can be updated / upgraded to EE etc.).

For more details on the internals, please read the
[How it works](./how_it_works.md) documentation.

## [Supported Remote Grid environment variables](./running_against_remote_grid.md)

## Running tests with a feature flag enabled

It is possible to enable or disable a feature flag before running tests.
To test a GitLab image with a feature flag enabled, run this command:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image gitlab/gitlab-ee:12.4.0-ee.0 --enable-feature feature_flag_name
```

To run a test with feature flag disabled, run this command:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image gitlab/gitlab-ee:12.4.0-ee.0 --disable-feature feature_flag_name
```

You can also test a GitLab image multiple times with different feature flag settings:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image gitlab/gitlab-ee:12.4.0-ee.0 --disable-feature feature_flag_name --enable-feature feature_flag_name
```

This will first disable `feature_flag_name` flag and run the tests and then enable it and run the tests again.

You can pass any number of feature flag settings. The tests will run once for each setting.

See the [QA framework documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/qa/README.md#running-tests-with-a-feature-flag-enabled-or-disabled)
for information on running the tests with different feature flag settings from the QA framework.

## Running tests with multiple feature flags set

The options above allow you to enable or disable a single feature flag at a time. However, if you want to set more than
one feature flag at the same time you'll need to use `--set-feature-flags` instead.

The desired state must be set individually for each feature flag in a comma-separated list. For example to disable a feature flag
named `feature-one` and enable another named `feature-two`, use the following parameters:

```shell
--set-feature-flags feature-one=disable,feature-two=enable
```

Those parameters will instruct GitLab QA to set both feature flags before running the suite of tests.

## Specifying the GitLab version

In each of the examples below, it is possible to test a specific version of GitLab
by providing the full image name, or an abbreviation followed by the image tag.

For example, to test GitLab version `12.4.0-ee`, the image tag is [`12.4.0-ee.0`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/gitlab/gitlab-ee/12.4.0-ee.0/images/sha256-65df19d8abbb0debdccb64bfe96871563806098cd84da0b818ae8cfdd928b9aa)
and so you could run the tests with the command:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image gitlab/gitlab-ee:12.4.0-ee.0
```

Or with the command:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE:12.4.0-ee.0
```

If you only provide the abbreviation, it will run the tests against the latest nightly image.

For example, the following command would use the image named `gitlab/gitlab-ee:nightly`

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE
```

To run EE tests, the `EE_LICENSE` environment variable needs to be set:

`$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/GitLab.gitlab_license)`

## Specifying the GitLab QA image to use

By default, `gitlab-qa` infers the QA image to use based on the GitLab image.
For instance, if you run the following:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image gitlab/gitlab-ee:12.4.0-ee.0
```

Then, `gitlab-qa` would infer `gitlab/gitlab-ee-qa:12.4.0-ee.0` as the QA image
based on the GitLab image (note the `-qa` suffix in the image name).

In some cases, you'll want to use a specific QA image instead of letting
`gitlab-qa` infer the QA image name from the GitLab image. Such cases can be
when you're doing local debugging/testing and you want to control the QA image
name, or in the CI where the QA image might be built by a project (e.g.
`gitlab-org/gitlab`, and the GitLab image might be built by another project
(e.g. `gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab-mirror`)).

To specify the QA image to use, pass the `--qa-image QA_IMAGE` option,
as follows:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image --qa-image registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-ee-qa:branch-name EE
```

Additionally, setting the `$QA_IMAGE` environment variable achieve the same result,
without needing to pass the `--qa-image` option:

```shell
$ export QA_IMAGE="registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/gitlab-ee-qa:branch-name"
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE
```

## Running a specific test (or set of tests)

In most of the scenarios listed below, if you don't want to run all the tests
it's possible to specify one or more tests. The framework uses RSpec, so tests can be
specified as you would when using RSpec.

For example, the following would run `create_merge_request_spec.rb`:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE -- qa/specs/features/browser_ui/3_create/merge_request/create_merge_request_spec.rb
```

While the following would run all Create UI tests:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE -- qa/specs/features/browser_ui/3_create
```

And the following would run all Create API tests as well as UI tests:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE -- qa/specs/features/browser_ui/3_create qa/specs/features/api/3_create
```

## Examples

### `Test::Instance::Image CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests that a GitLab Docker container works as expected by running
instance-level tests against it.

To run tests against the GitLab containers, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the `Test::Instance`
scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab/qa/qa/scenario/test/instance.rb`][test-instance] in the
GitLab project).

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image CE
```

### `Test::Omnibus::Image CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests that a GitLab Docker container can start without any error.

This spins up a GitLab Docker container based on the given edition or image:

- `gitlab/gitlab-ce:nightly` for `CE`
- `gitlab/gitlab-ee:nightly` for `EE`
- the given custom image for `<full image address>`

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Omnibus::Image CE
```

### `Test::Omnibus::Upgrade CE|<full image address>`

This tests that:

- the GitLab Docker container works as expected by running instance-level tests
  against it (see `Test::Instance::Image` above)
- it can be upgraded to a corresponding EE container
- the new GitLab container still works as expected by running
  `Test::Instance::Image` against it

Example:

```shell
# Upgrade from gitlab/gitlab-ce:nightly to gitlab/gitlab-ee:nightly
$ gitlab-qa Test::Omnibus::Upgrade CE

# Upgrade from gitlab/gitlab-ce:my-custom-tag to gitlab/gitlab-ee:my-custom-tag
$ gitlab-qa Test::Omnibus::Upgrade gitlab/gitlab-ce:my-custom-tag
```

### `Test::Omnibus::UpdateFromPrevious <full image address> <current_version> <major|minor> <from_edition>`

Scenario verifies upgrade from previous (major|minor) version to current release.

- Deploys previous (major|minor) version and runs Smoke test suite
  to populate data in database before upgrade
- Generates upgrade path following current GitLab recommendations
  from ['gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab'](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/raw/master/config/upgrade_path.yml) project
- Gradually upgrades GitLab instances to `<current_version>`
  associated with provided `<full image address>` and runs tests against it

Example:

```shell
# Minor upgrade - will perform upgrade 15.5.x -> gitlab-ee:dev-tag
$ gitlab-qa Test::Omnibus::UpdateFromPrevious gitlab-ee:dev-tag 15.6.0-pre minor

# Major upgrade - will perform upgrades 14.10.x -> 15.0.x -> 15.4.x -> gitlab-ee:dev-tag (15.6.0-pre)
$ gitlab-qa Test::Omnibus::UpdateFromPrevious gitlab-ee:dev-tag 15.6.0-pre major
```

### `Test::Integration::Geo EE|<full image address>`

This tests that Geo UI proxying is working as expected.

The scenario spins up primary and secondary GitLab Geo nodes and
can be used to verify that web requests to secondary Geo site return
data that is present on the primary.

See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/secondary_proxy

To run tests against the GitLab containers, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`QA::EE::Scenario::Test::Geo` scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab-ee@qa/qa/ee/scenario/test/geo.rb`][test-geo] in the GitLab
EE project).

**Required environment variables:**

- `EE_LICENSE`: A valid EE license.

Example:

```shell
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/Geo.gitlab_license)
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::Geo EE
```

[test-cvs]: ...

### `Test::Integration::ContinuousVulnerabilityScanning EE|<full image address>`

This tests [Continuous Vulnerability Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/continuous_vulnerability_scanning/)
which is functionality to allow updated vulnerabilities to be downloaded and shown for
relevant software dependencies.

It is designed to run against a particular end to end spec as per the example.

It is EE functionality and requires a license to be set.

**Required environment variables:**

- `EE_LICENSE`: A valid EE license.

Example:

```shell
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/gitlab_license)
$ export GITLAB_LICENSE_MODE=test
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::ContinuousVulnerabilityScanning EE
````

[test-geo]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/qa/qa/ee/scenario/test/geo.rb

### `Test::Integration::GitalyCluster CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests [Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html),
a clustered configuration of the Gitaly repository storage service.

The scenario configures and starts several docker containers to
represent the [recommended minimum configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#requirements-for-configuring-a-gitaly-cluster)
of a Gitaly Cluster.

To run tests against the GitLab container, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Instance::All` scenario with the `:gitaly_cluster` tag.

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::GitalyCluster EE
```

### `Test::Integration::GitlabPages CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests that a GitLab Instance works as expected with [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) enabled.

The scenario configures the instance by setting up these instructions [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/main/doc/howto/pages.md) through enabling `gitlab_pages['enable'] = true;`, setting up an external URL and the adding of the GitLab Pages hostname and GitLab Instance IP into the `etc/hostfile` on the container that runs the specs, so it can access the page on the GitLab container.

To run tests against the GitLab container, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Instance::All` scenario with the `:gitlab_pages` tag.

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::GitlabPages EE
```

### `Test::Integration::LDAPNoTLS CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests that a GitLab instance works as expected with an external
LDAP server with TLS not enabled.

The scenario spins up an OpenLDAP server, seeds users, and verifies
that LDAP-related features work as expected.

To run tests against the GitLab containers, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Integration::LDAPNoTLS` scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab/qa/qa/scenario/test/integration/ldap_no_tls.rb`][test-integration-ldap-no-tls]
in the GitLab project).

In EE, both the GitLab standard and LDAP credentials are needed:

1. The first is used to login as an Admin to enter in the EE license.
2. The second is used to conduct LDAP-related tasks

**Required environment variables:**

- [For EE only] `EE_LICENSE`: A valid EE license.

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::LDAPNoTLS CE

# For EE
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/Geo.gitlab_license)

$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::LDAPNoTLS EE
```

[test-integration-ldap-no-tls]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/qa/qa/scenario/test/integration/ldap_no_tls.rb

### `Test::Integration::LDAPTLS CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests that a TLS enabled GitLab instance works as expected with an external TLS enabled LDAP server.
The self-signed TLS certificate used for the GitLab instance and the private key is located at: [`gitlab-org/gitlab-qa@tls_certificates/gitlab`][test-integration-ldap-tls-certs]

The certificate was generated with OpenSSL using this command:

```shell
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout gitlab.test.key -out gitlab.test.crt -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=San Francisco/O=GitLab/OU=Org/CN=gitlab.test"
```

The scenario spins up a TLS enabled OpenLDAP server, seeds users, and verifies
that LDAP-related features work as expected.

To run tests against the GitLab containers, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Integration::LDAPTLS` scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab/qa/qa/scenario/test/integration/ldap_tls.rb`][test-integration-ldap-tls]
in the GitLab project).

In EE, both the GitLab standard and LDAP credentials are needed:

1. The first is used to login as an Admin to enter in the EE license.
2. The second is used to conduct LDAP-related tasks

**Required environment variables:**

- [For EE only] `EE_LICENSE`: A valid EE license.

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::LDAPTLS CE

# For EE
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/Geo.gitlab_license)

$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::LDAPTLS EE
```

[test-integration-ldap-tls]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/qa/qa/scenario/test/integration/ldap_tls.rb
[test-integration-ldap-tls-certs]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/tls_certificates/gitlab

### `Test::Integration::LDAPNoServer EE|<full image address>`

This configures a GitLab instance for use with LDAP but does not
spin up an LDAP server in a docker container.

The LDAP server is created at runtime by the spec so that
the test can provide the fixture data for the LDAP server
as needed.

To run tests against the GitLab containers, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Integration::LDAPNoServer` scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab@qa/qa/scenario/test/integration/ldap_no_server.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/qa/qa/scenario/test/integration/ldap_no_server.rb)
in the GitLab project).

In GitLab project, both the GitLab standard and LDAP credentials are needed:

1. The first is used to login as an Admin to enter in the GitLab license.
2. The second is used to conduct LDAP-related tasks

**Required environment variables:**

- `EE_LICENSE`: A valid Enterprise license.

Example:

```shell
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/GitLab.gitlab_license)

### `Test::Integration::Packages CE|EE|<full image address>`

**Note: This Scenario no longer exists.  See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/-/merge_requests/662**

To run Packages tests, you may [configure Omnibus](configuring_omnibus.md) to use the [Packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/qa/runtime/omnibus_configurations/packages.rb) configurator.

Example:

```shell
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/Geo.gitlab_license)

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE --omnibus-config packages
```

This tests the GitLab Package Registry feature by setting
`gitlab_rails['packages_enabled'] = true` in the Omnibus configuration
before starting the GitLab container.

To run tests against the GitLab container, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the

### `Test::Integration::SMTP CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests SMTP notification email delivery from Gitlab by using
[MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) as MTA.
It starts up a Docker container for MailHog and sets the Omnibus configuration
to use it for SMTP delivery. The MailHog container will expose the configured
port for SMTP delivery, and also another port for the HTTP MailHog API used for
querying the delivered messages.

To run tests against the GitLab container, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Integration::SMTP` scenario.

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::SMTP CE
```

### `Test::Integration::Jira CE|EE|<full image address>`

This tests that a GitLab instance works as expected with an external
Jira server.

```

### `Test::Instance::Staging`

This scenario tests that the [`staging.gitlab.com`](https://staging.gitlab.com)
works as expected by running tests against it.

To run tests against the GitLab instance, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Instance` scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab/qa/qa/scenario/test/instance.rb`][test-instance] in the
GitLab project).

**Required environment variables:**

- `GITLAB_QA_USER_AGENT`: The browser user-agent to use instead of the default Chrome user-agent.
  This is needed for the automated tests to bypass the WAF

  `gitlab-qa-bot` on `dev.gitlab.org` with the `registry` scope.
  This is used to pull the QA Docker image from the Omnibus GitLab `dev` Container Registry.
  If the variable isn't present, the QA image from Docker Hub will be used.
  This can be found in the shared 1Password vault.
  Please note that this variable must be provided when you need to be sure the version of the
  tests matches the version of GitLab on Staging. If the version from Docker Hub is used it might not include changes deployed to Staging very recently.

An example of how to run the smoke tests:

```shell
$ export GITLAB_QA_USER_AGENT="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_QA_DEV_ACCESS_TOKEN="<value from 1Password>"

$ export QA_PRAEFECT_REPOSITORY_STORAGE="nfs-file22"

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Staging -- --tag smoke
```

### `Test::Instance::StagingRef`

This scenario tests that the [`Staging Ref`](https://staging-ref.gitlab.com)
works as expected by running tests against it.

To run tests against the GitLab instance, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the

$ export GITLAB_USERNAME="gitlab-qa"
$ export GITLAB_PASSWORD="$GITLAB_QA_PASSWORD"

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::StagingRef
```

### `Test::Instance::StagingRefGeo`

This scenario tests that the Geo staging deployment (with [`staging-ref.gitlab.com`](https://staging-ref.gitlab.com) as the primary site and [`geo.staging-ref.gitlab.com`](https://geo.staging-ref.gitlab.com) as the secondary site) works as expected by running tests tagged `:geo` against it. This is done by spinning up a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`) container and running the `QA::EE::Scenario::Test::Geo` scenario. Note that the Geo setup steps in the `QA::EE::Scenario::Test::Geo` scenario are skipped when testing a live Geo deployment.

**Required user properties:**

- The user must provide OAuth authorization on the secondary site before running Geo tests. This can be done via the authorization modal that appears after logging into the secondary node for the first time.

- Some Geo tests require the user to have Admin access level (for example, the Geo Nodes API tests)

**Required environment variables:**

- `GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN`: A valid personal access token with the `api` scope.
  This is used to retrieve the version that staging is currently running.

$ export GITLAB_USERNAME="gitlab-qa"
$ export GITLAB_PASSWORD="$GITLAB_QA_PASSWORD"

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::StagingRefGeo
```

### `Test::Instance::Production`

This scenario functions the same as `Test::Instance::Staging`
but will run tests against [`gitlab.com`](https://gitlab.com).

In release 11.6 it is possible to test against the canary stage of production
by setting `QA_COOKIES=gitlab_canary=true`. This adds a cookie
to all web requests which will result in them being routed
to the canary fleet.

**Required environment variables:**

- `GITLAB_QA_USER_AGENT`: The browser user-agent to use instead of the default Chrome user-agent.
  This is needed for the automated tests to bypass the WAF

- `GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN`: A valid personal access token with the `api` scope.

  This can be found in the shared 1Password vault.
  Please note that this variable should be provided when you need to be sure the version of the
  tests matches the version of GitLab on Staging. If the version from Docker Hub is used it might not include changes deployed to Staging very recently.

An example of how to run the smoke tests:

```shell
$ export GITLAB_QA_USER_AGENT="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_QA_DEV_ACCESS_TOKEN="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_USERNAME="gitlab-qa"
$ export GITLAB_PASSWORD="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_QA_USERNAME_1="gitlab-qa-user1"
$ export GITLAB_QA_PASSWORD_1="<value from 1Password>"
$ export QA_CAN_TEST_GIT_PROTOCOL_V2="false"
$ export QA_CAN_TEST_ADMIN_FEATURES="false"
$ export QA_CAN_TEST_PRAEFECT="false"

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Production -- --tag smoke
```

### `Test::Instance::Preprod`

This scenario functions the same as `Test::Instance::Staging`
but will run tests against [`pre.gitlab.com`](https://pre.gitlab.com).

Note that [`pre.gitlab.com`](https://pre.gitlab.com) is used as an Interim
Performance Testbed and [will be replaced with the actual testbed in the future](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/60).

### `Test::Instance::Release`

This scenario functions the same as `Test::Instance::Staging`
but will run tests against [`release.gitlab.net`](https://release.gitlab.net).

### `Test::Instance::Smoke`

This scenario will run a limited amount of tests selected from the test suite tagged by `:smoke`.
Smoke tests are quick tests that ensure that some basic functionality of GitLab works.

To run tests against the GitLab instance, a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container is spun up and tests are run from it by running the
`Test::Instance::Smoke` scenario (located under
[`gitlab-org/gitlab/qa/qa/scenario/test/smoke.rb`][smoke-instance] in the
GitLab project).

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Smoke ee:<tag> https://staging.gitlab.com
```

### `Test::Instance::RepositoryStorage`

This scenario will run a limited number of tests that are tagged with `:repository_storage`.

These tests verify features related to multiple repository storages.

**Required environment variables:**

- `QA_ADDITIONAL_REPOSITORY_STORAGE`: The name of the non-default repository storage.
- `QA_PRAEFECT_REPOSITORY_STORAGE`: The name of the gitaly cluster (praefect) repository storage.
- `QA_GITALY_NON_CLUSTER_STORAGE`: The name of a non gitaly cluster repository storage.

Example:

```shell
$ export QA_ADDITIONAL_REPOSITORY_STORAGE=secondary
$ export QA_GITALY_NON_CLUSTER_STORAGE=gitaly
$ export QA_PRAEFECT_REPOSITORY_STORAGE=praefect

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::RepositoryStorage
```

### `Test::Instance::Airgapped`

This scenario will run tests from the test suite against an airgapped instance.
The airgapped instance is set up by using `iptables` in the GitLab container to block network traffic other than testable ports, and by using runners
in a shared internal network.

Example:

```shell
# For EE
$ export EE_LICENSE=$(cat /path/to/gitlab_license)

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Airgapped EE -- --tag smoke
```

### `Test::Instance::Image CE|EE|<full image address> --omnibus-config object_storage`

This orchestrated scenario runs tests from the test suite against a GitLab instance which has object storage configured instead of using local storage. The omnibus configuration `object_storage` ([configurator](configuring_omnibus.md)), uses Minio and `object_storage_aws` uses an AWS S3 account with credentials configured in the pipeline as CI Variables. To use Google Cloud Storage pass `--omnibus-config object_storage_gcp`. According to the storage selected it requires:

| Scenario              | Variable            | Description                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| AWS S3 Object Storage | AWS_S3_REGION       | AWS region where bucket is created   |
| AWS S3 Object Storage | AWS_S3_KEY_ID       | AWS credentials                      |
| AWS S3 Object Storage | AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY   | AWS credentials                      |
| AWS S3 Object Storage | AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME  | Name of the bucket set in AWS        |
| GCP Object Storage    | GCS_BUCKET_NAME     | Name of the bucket set in AWS        |
| GCP Object Storage    | GOOGLE_JSON_KEY     | JSON key credential                  |
| GCP Object Storage    | GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL | Email address of the service account |
| GCP Object Storage    | GOOGLE_PROJECT      | GCP project name                     |

These variables are available at 1Password QA Vault.

### `Test::Integration::RegistryTLS EE`

It uses GitLab's TLS certificate found in the [`tls_certificates`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/-/blob/master/tls_certificates/gitlab/gitlab.test.crt) folder.

To run a scenario with an insecure registry enabled use `Test::Integration::Registry EE` instead (it does not require the above certificate).

### `Test::Integration::RegistryTLS EE --omnibus-config object_storage`

This scenario is a composition of two orchestrated scenarios. It tests the container registry (TLS-enabled) integrated with an object storage backend.

An example would be to pass the option `--omnibus-config object_storage_aws` and the registry will be pulling and pushing images using AWS Cloud Storage as a storage backend.

```shell
gitlab-qa Test::Integration::RegistryTLS EE --omnibus-config object_storage_aws
```

### `Test::Instance::Image EE --omnibus-config decomposition_single_db`

**Note: The default Omnibus config is using a single database
with [two database connections](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#configuring-multiple-database-connections)**

This scenario is to run tests against a GitLab instance using a single database with only one `main` connection:

```ruby
gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE --omnibus-config decomposition_single_db
```

### `Test::Instance::Image EE --omnibus-config decomposition_multiple_db`

This scenario is to run tests against a GitLab instance using [multiple databases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/multiple_databases.html):

```ruby
gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Image EE --omnibus-config decomposition_multiple_db
```

### `Test::Instance::Geo EE|<full image address>:nightly|latest|any_tag http://geo-primary.gitlab http://geo-secondary.gitlab`

This scenario will run tests tagged `:geo` against a live Geo deployment, by spinning up a GitLab QA (`gitlab/gitlab-qa`)
container and running the `QA::EE::Scenario::Test::Geo` scenario. Note that the Geo setup steps in the `QA::EE::Scenario::Test::Geo` scenario are skipped when testing a live Geo deployment. The URLs for the primary site and secondary site of the live Geo deployment must be provided as command line arguments.

**Required user properties:**

- The user must provide OAuth authorization on the secondary site before running Geo tests. This can be done via the authorization modal that appears after signing in to the secondary node for the first time.

- Some Geo tests require the user to have Admin access level (for example, the Geo Nodes API tests)

Example:

```shell
$ export GITLAB_USERNAME="gitlab-qa"
$ export GITLAB_PASSWORD="$GITLAB_QA_PASSWORD"

$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Geo EE https://primary.gitlab.com https://secondary.gitlab.com
```

### `Test::Instance::Chaos`

This scenario will run a limited number of tests that are tagged with `:chaos`.

These tests are designed to verify that our systems can gracefully handle scenarios which may occur if
networking or connectivity type issues occur in various Gitlab components.
They make use of [toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) to act as a proxy allowing us to introduce
connectivity issues, via the [toxiproxy ruby client](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy-ruby) in an E2E spec.

Sample Test:

```ruby
  context 'when a gitaly node is experiencing high latency' do
    it 'can create a project' do
      Toxiproxy[:gitaly1].toxic(:latency, latency: 30000).apply do
        expect(create_a_project).to be true
      end
    end
  end
```

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Instance::Chaos
```

### `Test::Integration::Import`

This scenario will run specs tagged with `:import` tags.

These tests are designed to validate import functionality by importing projects from `GitHub` or another `GitLab` instance.
This scenario type spins up 2 gitlab instances and additionally an instance with simple http mock server.

Example:

```shell
$ gitlab-qa Test::Integration::Import
```

#### GitHub

Setup uses [smocker](https://smocker.dev/) mock server for mocking all interactions with `GitHub`. By default environment variable `QA_MOCK_GITHUB` is
set to `true` which adds host entry to `import-target` docker container to redirect all requests for `api.github.com` dns name to mock container.

All mock definitions are defined in [github.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/qa/qa/fixtures/mocks/import/github.yml) file. When mock definitions
need to be updated, it can be useful to proxy all requests to real `GitHub` instance and recording all requests and responses.

#### GitLab

Testing import [by direct transfer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrate-groups-by-direct-transfer-recommended) is done by spinning up 2 omnibus installations - `import-target` and `import-source`. In order for tests to work, application setting `allow_local_requests_from_web_hooks_and_services` must be enabled in target instance. This is automatically done by test process if environment variable `QA_ALLOW_LOCAL_REQUESTS` is set to `true`.

### `AiGateway` Scenarios

The following `AiGateway` scenarios spin up a GitLab Omnibus instance integrated with a test AI Gateway using [mocked models](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist#mocking-ai-model-responses). These scenarios help to verify various configurations of cloud licensing and seat assignment work as expected when authenticating for AI features on self-managed instances.

**Required environment variables:**

All scenarios below require the following environment variables, **_unless otherwise noted:_**

- `QA_EE_ACTIVATION_CODE`: An activation code for a Staging-generated Premium or Ultimate cloud license with a purchased Duo Pro or Duo Enterprise add-on. This can be found in the GitLab QA 1Password vault.
- `GITLAB_LICENSE_MODE`: Set to `test` in order to configure GitLab Omnibus with the correct license mode and `CUSTOMER_PORTAL_URL`.

Example:

```shell
$ export QA_EE_ACTIVATION_CODE="<value from 1Password>"
$ export GITLAB_LICENSE_MODE="test"
```

----

#### `Test::Integration::AiGateway EE|<full image address>`
