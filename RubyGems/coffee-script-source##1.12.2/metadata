      CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
      Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons,
      JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart.
      CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript
      in a simple way.
