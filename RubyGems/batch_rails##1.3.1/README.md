# The Batch icon set for the asset-pipeline

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'batch-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install batch-rails
    
Now require it in your application.css

    *= require 'batch'

## Usage

This essentially just puts the [Batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/) icon set on the asset pipeline. 
The versioning follows the icon sets official versioning which is currently at 1.3. 
A guide on how to use batch can be found [here](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Batch/tree/master/Webfont)
