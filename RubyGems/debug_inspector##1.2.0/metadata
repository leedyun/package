  Adds methods to DebugInspector to allow for inspection of backtrace frames.

  The debug_inspector C extension and API were designed and built by Koichi Sasada, this project is just a gemification of his work.

  This library makes use of the debug inspector API which was added to MRI 2.0.0.
  Only works on MRI 2 and 3. Requiring it on unsupported Rubies will result in a no-op.

  Recommended for use only in debugging situations. Do not use this in production apps.
