description: This is a library to simulate SSL and TLS handshake from SSLv2, SSLv3,
  to TLS 1.0-1.2. It does not rely on OpenSSL and is not designed as a replacement
  either. It targets full support for even older handshakes, which are not available
  in current releases of OpenSSL anymore. It also aims to be executable on all systems
  with a sufficiently modern version of Ruby without any additional requirements or
  pre-compiled binaries.
