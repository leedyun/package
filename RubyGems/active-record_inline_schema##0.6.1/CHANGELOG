0.6.1 / 2013-03-15

* Enhancements

  * :dry_run option that just prints info to your log
  * if AR::Base#primary_key is false-y (e.g. you set Pet.primary_key = false), don't automatically create a primary key column

0.6.0 / 2012-11-29

* Breaking changes

  * auto_upgrade!'s first argument is now a generic options hash - if you want to pass create table options, use options[:create_table]

* Enhancements

  * Add "gentle" mode where unrecognized columns and indexes are not dropped. Just pass :gentle => true to auto_upgrade!
  * Better detect when a user specifies a non-standard primary key but doesn't actually specify any columns.

0.5.9 / 2012-07-26

* Bug fixes

  * Don't try to use ActiveRecord::Base.checkout with SQLite - it causes "Could not find table" errors

0.5.8 / 2012-07-26

* Breaking changes

  * No longer automatically adds inheritance columns - you should specify them like "col :type"

* Enhancements

  * A bit more testing of how primary keys work.

* Notes

  * Something is going horribly wrong with SQLite support - lots of "Could not find table" errors. Hoping we can revisit this when sqlite3 gem 1.3.7 comes out.

0.5.7 / 2012-06-22

* Bug fix

  * In MySQL, properly create non-standard primary keys for one-column tables.

0.5.6 / 2012-06-22

* Enhancements

  * Support non-autoincrementing integer primary keys in MySQL

0.5.5 / 2012-06-20

* Enhancements

  * Remove lock_method stuff that really wasn't helping.

0.5.4 / 2012-05-08

* Enhancements

  * Slightly better way to get name of current database for locking purposes.

0.5.3 / 2012-04-24

* Enhancements

  * Cache name of the current database to speed things up.

0.5.2 / 2012-04-19

* Bug fixes

  * Fix indexes on multiple columns. Amazing how much damage a single #to_s can do.

0.5.1 / 2012-04-19

* Bug fixes

  * Fix require order... rookie mistake.

0.5.0 / 2012-04-19

* Known issues

  * Custom inheritance columns will be ignored unless you have activerecord >3.2.3 (unreleased as of this writing). The bug is https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5327

* Breaking changes

  * the block form (schema {}) is removed
  * .col only accepts one column at a time
  * .col no longer accepts :as => :references
      was: col :group, :as => :references
      now: col :group_id, :type => :integer
  * .col no longer accepts :index => true
      was: col :foo, :index => true
      now: col :foo and then add_index :foo
  * A whole bunch of class methods are no longer mixed into ActiveRecord::Base (see Enhancements below)

* Enhancements

  * Database connection no longer needs to be established before you define columns/indexes (but of course you have to connect before you auto_upgrade!)
  * Only adds four (4) class methods to ActiveRecord::Base: .auto_upgrade!, .col, .add_index, and .inline_schema_config
  * Tested on MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9, and JRuby 1.6.7+ across mysql, postgresql, and sqlite3
  * Simply and DRY via a big refactor

## Difference between mini_record v0.2.1 and active_record_inline_schema v0.4.0

Having diverged at [this commit](https://github.com/DAddYE/mini_record/commit/55b2545f9772f7500d3782ac530b3da456f50023), I did stuff like...

* didn't set primary key on table definition
* allow custom column types
* removed aliases
* shorten name with zlib trick
* allow passing create_table_options
* default to ENGINE=InnoDB on mysql
* detect and create table for non-standard primary key
* move where schema inheritance columns are defined
* removed table_definition accessor
* allow custom column types like `varbinary`
* more compatible with ActiveRecord 3.0 and 3.2.2

## Difference between mini_record v0.2.1 and mini_record v0.3.0 (which I didn't fork)

After I made this list, I decided to diverge from mini_record v0.2.1 instead of doing a pull request:

* allow custom column types
* add timestamps
* remove unused (unmentioned) tables
* call auto_upgrade on descendant tables
* automagically generate fields from associations
* revised difference checking code

Pity the forker (me)!
