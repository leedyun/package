  A Ruby implementation of the Patience diff algorithm.

  Patience Diff creates more readable diffs than other algorithms in some cases, particularly when much of the content has changed between the documents being compared. There's a great explanation and example [here][example].

  Patience diff was originally written by Bram Cohen and is used in the [Bazaar][bazaar] version control system. This version is loosely based off the Python implementation in Bazaar.
