post_install_message: "Starting from 5.5.0 RC1 Doorkeeper requires client authentication
  for Resource Owner Password Grant\nas stated in the OAuth RFC. You have to create
  a new OAuth client (Doorkeeper::Application) if you didn't\nhave it before and use
  client credentials in HTTP Basic auth if you previously used this grant flow without\nclient
  authentication. \n\nTo opt out of this you could set the \"skip_client_authentication_for_password_grant\"
  configuration option\nto \"true\", but note that this is in violation of the OAuth
  spec and represents a security risk.\n\nRead https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/561#issuecomment-612857163
