  This is a heavily modified fork of http://github.com/defunkt/colored gem, with many
  sensible pull requests combined. Since the authors of the original gem no longer support it,
  this might, perhaps, be considered a good alternative.

  Simple gem that adds various color methods to String class, and can be used as follows:

    require 'colored2'

    puts 'this is red'.red
    puts 'this is red with a yellow background'.red.on.yellow
    puts 'this is red with and italic'.red.italic
    puts 'this is green bold'.green.bold << ' and regular'.green
    puts 'this is really bold blue on white but reversed'.bold.blue.on.white.reversed
    puts 'this is regular, but '.red! << 'this is red '.yellow! << ' and yellow.'.no_color!
    puts ('this is regular, but '.red! do
      'this is red '.yellow! do
        ' and yellow.'.no_color!
      end
    end)
